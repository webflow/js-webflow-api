        Upload a supported well-known file to a site.


        The current restrictions on well-known files are as follows:
          - Each file must be smaller than 100kb
          - Less than 30 total files
          - Have one of the following file extensions (or no extension): `.txt`, `.json`, `.noext` 
          
          <Note title=".noext">
            `.noext` is a special file extension that removes other extensions. For example, `apple-app-site-association.noext.txt` will be uploaded as `apple-app-site-association`. Use this extension for tools that have trouble uploading extensionless files.
          </Note>
